# Everything Calgary - DGDT Final Project

“Ask not what you can do for your city, ask what my city is doing for me?” 

Governments around the world are embracing open data. You have the possibility to gain deeper access to the inner workings of your City Hall. The ‘Everything City’ platform leverages standard APIs to respond to a variety of possible queries. Responses are contextualized by a neighborhood-first perspective and can range from property values, to current and proposed development, recent traffic information,crime incidents, and more. Starting in our hometown we are launching Everything Calgary: making it easy to satisfy your curiosity about what’s happening in your neighbourhood as well as the city as a whole. 

## Getting Started

In order to get started with this project, you will need to run two servers: one for the front-end (React) and one for the back-end (Node.js/Express). You need to run `npm install` to install all dependencies for both front- and back-end. Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to view the Everything Calgary web app.
